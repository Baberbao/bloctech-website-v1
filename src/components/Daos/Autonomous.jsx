                Smart contract development is behind the foundation of the DAO.
                Samrt contracts regulate the rules of the organization and group
                treasury. Once the smart contract is conveyed to live on the
                Ethereum platform, then no one can make variations in the rules
                guidance except by a consensus. This is possible because smart
                contracts are tamper-proof once they go live on Ethereum.
              </li>
              <li style={{ marginBottom: "10px" }}>
                It will fail if someone tries to change something that isn't
                covered by the code's rules and reasons. Because the treasury is
                also established by the smart contract, no one can use the money
                without the permission of the organization.
              </li>
              <li style={{ marginBottom: "10px" }}>
                As a result, DAOs do not necessitate a centralized authority.
                Instead, the group makes decisions collectively, and when votes
                are passed, transactions are automatically permitted. You can't
                arbitrarily change the code (the DAO's rules) without everyone
                noticing because everything is public.

              BlocTech Solutions is a premium Blockchain development company
              that offers DAO Blockchain service. DAOs are also incredibly
              transparent like Everything is recorded, and votes, proposals, and
              even the code can be audited, making DAOs extremely transparent.
              In comparison to traditional work environments, DAO is the idea of
              self-sustainability.
              <br />
              <br />
              We create sophisticated dApps, like crypto wallets, allowing DAO
              users to earn and trade on the platform. As well as the creation
              of DAO smart contracts, Users can engage in different activities
              independently using dApps.
